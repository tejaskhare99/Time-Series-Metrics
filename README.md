# Custom Evaluation Metrics

This repository includes a collection of custom evaluation metrics that can be useful for assessing the performance of predictive models. These metrics cover various aspects of prediction accuracy, error, and directional accuracy.

## Metrics List

1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predictions and actual values.
2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: RMSE is the square root of the MSE, providing a measure of the average magnitude of errors.
3. **Normalized RMSE (NRMSE)**: RMSE scaled by the range of the true values, providing a relative error measure.
4. **Mean Error (ME)**: Measures the average of errors (residuals).
5. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Computes the average absolute differences between predictions and actual values.
6. **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)**: Measures the median absolute difference between predictions and actual values.
7. **Geometric Mean Absolute Error (GMAE)**: GMAE is a geometric mean of the absolute errors.
8. **Median Absolute Deviation of Errors (MdAE)**: Measures the median absolute difference of errors.
9. **Mean Percentage Error (MPE)**: Computes the average percentage difference between predictions and actual values.
10. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Calculates the average absolute percentage difference.
11. **Median Absolute Percentage Error (MdAPE)**: Measures the median absolute percentage difference.
12. **Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)**: Provides a symmetric percentage difference measure.
13. **Symmetric Median Absolute Percentage Error (SMDAPE)**: A symmetric version of MdAPE.
14. **Mean Arctangent Absolute Percentage Error (MAAPE)**: Utilizes the arctangent function for better stability.
15. **Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE)**: Scales the MAE by the mean absolute error of a naive forecast.
16. **Standardized Absolute Error (std_AE)**: Standardizes the absolute errors.
17. **Standardized Absolute Percentage Error (std_APE)**: Standardizes the absolute percentage errors.
18. **Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE)**: Computes the RMS of percentage differences.
19. **Root Median Squared Percentage Error (RMDSPE)**: Similar to RMSPE but uses the median.
20. **Root Mean Squared Scaled Error (RMSSE)**: Scales the RMSE by the mean absolute error of a naive forecast.
21. **Integrated Normalized Root Squared Error (INRSE)**: An integrated version of the NRMSE.
22. **Relative Root Squared Error (RRSE)**: Measures the relative RMSE.
23. **Mean Relative Error (MRE)**: Computes the average relative difference.
24. **Relative Absolute Error (RAE)**: Measures the relative absolute differences.
25. **Mean Relative Absolute Error (MRAE)**: Calculates the average of RAE.
26. **Median Relative Absolute Error (MdRAE)**: Measures the median of RAE.
27. **Geometric Mean Relative Absolute Error (GMRAE)**: Similar to GMAE but for relative errors.
28. **Mean Bounded Relative Absolute Error (MBRAE)**: A bounded version of MRAE.
29. **Unscaled Mean Bounded Relative Absolute Error (UMBRAE)**: Unscaled version of MBRAE.
30. **Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA)**: Measures the proportion of correct directional predictions.
